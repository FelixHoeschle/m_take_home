## READMORE ##
For better readability, I have split the task into two notebooks:
- 1_data_cleaning.ipynb
- 2_main_tasks.ipynb

The first notebook creates a cleaned version of the data which is then used in the second notebook.
Thus, the second notebook can only be run after the first notebook, otherwise the '_cleaned' .csv files do not exist.

I refrained from giving my comments a different color since it would then be unreadable either in dark or light mode.
Instead, I prefaced them with 'FELIX:'.
