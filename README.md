## READMORE ##
I have split the task into two notebooks:
- 1_data_cleaning.ipynb
- 2_main_tasks.ipynb

I hope this makes it easier to read.
The first notebook creates a cleaned version of the data which is then read in the second notebook.
This means, that the second notebook can only be run after the first notebook, otherwise the '_cleaned' csvs do not exist.

I refrained from given my comments a different color since it would then be unreadable either in dark or light mode.
Instead I prefaced them with 'FELIX:'.
